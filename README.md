## Public Modules
| **Module Name** | **GitHub URL** | **Module description** |
|------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| LLM battleground | https://github.com/Clarifai/module-llm-battleground | This module enables easy comparison and evaluation of many large language models and compare the responses. |
| Chatbot | https://github.com/Clarifai/module-chatbot | This module lets you chat with several Large Language Models and give a custom chatbot experience |
| DocQA | https://github.com/Clarifai/module-docQA| This is a demo app showcasing the usefullness of Retrieval Augmented Text Generation. This module includes 4 main pages:Upload: This page takes a pdf, parses it into chunks, and uploads it to a Clarifai app with metadata to track the source and page/chunk number.
Upload with Geo: This page takes a pdf, parses it into chunks, then extracts relevant locations using a LLM and uploads the text chunks and geo data to a Clarifai app.
Investigate: This page showcases different use cases such as semantic search for document retrieval, followed with NER (named-entity recognition), document summarization, and a "chat with the document" experience.
Geo Search: This page uses Clarifai semantic search and geo data search to retrieve relevant documents within a designated geo location, which can then used to ground the LLM generation for a summarization task. |
